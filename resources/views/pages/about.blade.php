<strong>A/B Testing Lab</strong> was born out of the need to run a few simple A/B tests at my job some years ago. To my surprise I saw many great solutions for marketers, but there was no fast and easy way to run A/B tests for the uninitiated. After a bit of research I rolled up my sleeves and got to work.

My name is Tadas Paplauskas and I'm a web developer from Lithuania. I'm the guy behind A/B Testing Lab. This is my passion project and I want to make it an awesome tool for content creators to test their ideas and draw insights about their visitors.
